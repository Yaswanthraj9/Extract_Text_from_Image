  <p>  OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is an electronic computer-based approach to convert images of text into machine-encoded text, which can then be       extracted and used in text format. </p>
  <p> Tesseract is an open source OCR (optical character recognition) engine which allows to extract text from images.</p>
  <p> In order to use it in Python, we will also need the pytesseract library which is a wrapper for Tesseract engine.</p>
  <p> Since we are working with images, we will also need the pillow library which adds image processing capabilities to Python. </p>
